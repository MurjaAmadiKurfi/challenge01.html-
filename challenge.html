        <h1>Title: "Nature's Song"</h1>
        Under the open, endless sky,
Where peaks and valleys catch the eye,
Nature's song, a wondrous grace,
In melodies that fill the space.

Leaves in whispers softly speak,
A forest's secrets, hidden and meek,
Babbling brook and birds in flight,
Nature's song, pure and bright.

In meadows painted with colors true,
Birds sing freely, skies so blue,
Listen close, and you'll see,
Nature's song, wild and free.
